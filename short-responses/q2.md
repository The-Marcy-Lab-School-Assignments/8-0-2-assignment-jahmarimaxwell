# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
Environment Variables are hidden variable stored in a .env file that lives on the host (your laptop or a deployment host like Render) To access these variables in Node, you would type `console.log(process.env.API_KEY)` and this will print the API key to the console.
