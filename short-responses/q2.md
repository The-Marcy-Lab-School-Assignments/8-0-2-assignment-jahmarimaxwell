# Question

What are environment variables? How do you access them in Node?

# Answer
Environment Variables are hidden variable stored in a .env file that lives on the host (your laptop or a deployment host like Render) To access these variables in Node, you would type `console.log(process.env.API_KEY)` and this will print the API key to the console.

Awesome job! More specifically, you would use process.env, followed by the name of the variable. Environment variables can be more than just API keys.
