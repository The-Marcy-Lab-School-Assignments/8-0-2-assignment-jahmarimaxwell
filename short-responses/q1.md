# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
The API key is a way to identify you as a developer and receive access to request resources.The danger of making API requests with API keys from the the frontend is that there is a potiential risk of someone stealing data. For example, some APIs will charge you for each request that you make using your API key and if someone else gets a hold of your API key, they could steal your request resources. To prevent this, developers store their api key within a `.env` file which is short for environment file that is hidden when pushed to github.
